Perfect — let’s go step by step to **completely remove the `obj/` folder from your Git history** while keeping your repo private. This is the safest way to ensure no API keys or generated files are ever accessible, even in past commits.

---

## **Step 1 — Install `git-filter-repo`**

`git-filter-repo` is the modern, fast, and safe tool for rewriting Git history.

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install git-filter-repo
```

**Linux:**

```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

**Windows:**
Download from: [git-filter-repo releases](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/releases)

---

## **Step 2 — Remove the entire `obj/` folder from history**

Run this from the root of your repository:

```bash
git filter-repo --path-glob "*/obj/*" --invert-paths
```

**Explanation:**

* `--path-glob "*/obj/*"` matches all `obj/` folders in any subfolder.
* `--invert-paths` deletes the matched paths from every commit in history.

> This completely removes all `obj/` files from all past commits.

---

## **Step 3 — Force-push the cleaned history to GitHub**

Since we rewrote the history, we need to overwrite the remote:

```bash
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

> Your private repo will now have a **clean history** with no `obj/` files.

---

## **Step 4 — Prevent future commits of `obj/`**

Add `obj/` to `.gitignore` so it’s never committed again:

```bash
echo "obj/" >> .gitignore
git rm -r --cached obj
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Stop tracking obj folder"
git push
```

---

✅ **Done!** Now your repo is private, and all generated files (including any API keys in `obj/`) are removed from history.

---

If you want, I can also **write the exact full script** to clean your repo in one go, including all `obj/` folders and `bin/` folders, which are usually safe to ignore in .NET projects.

Do you want me to do that?
